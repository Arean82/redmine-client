# [WIP]Â Desktop Redmine client application

Based on Electron, this app can be launched on any Mac, Linux or Windows computer. 

**This is a Work In Progress**

So many things left to be done, working on it. This is not stable yet, nor really useful. More features to come soon.

## So what is working?

Listing: 
  - issues assigned to you
  - issues you have created
  - issues you are watching
  - all issues

Filtering: 
  - projects
  - trackers
  - statuses
  - priorities

## Usage

Checkout the repo, install the dependencies and run Gulp. 
There is no build yet, will be done soon.
